Yes, there were two other things that happened before today's incident: I had an episode of nausea at 7am with my stomach feeling upset and bloated, but I felt better after eating something; and then around 10am, when I started work, I went into my bathroom multiple times, taking a few minutes each time, for no reason. My husband said I looked pale during these visits, and he found me crying during one of them. When we returned home from work, I did not feel very well anymore, and I continued to have headaches and anxiety throughout the day. Finally, later in the evening, I started having trouble falling asleep due to extreme sleep disturbance, which lasted until bedtime.

The main thing is that I grew up with a father who was very proud of his heritage, but he didn't really care much for our community or culture. He'd rather spend time with other families and make friends outside of our circle. As a result, he never really promoted our cultural identity or involvement. This has affected both my mother and myself because we don't feel connected to our roots or our culture. We always felt like outsiders and second-class citizens in some aspects of life. It can be challenging growing up feeling unimportant or marginalized compared to others around us.
